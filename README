Hashauth is a set of tools that helps you manage your passwords. Hashauth
differs from traditional 'password managers' by deriving your passwords
from mathematical functions (hash functions) rather than storing them on
disk, and thus is completely liberated from password databases.

Key features
------------
* Helps you manage (most of) your passwords.

* Strong unique passwords for each resource (websites, e-mail accounts,
IMs, etc..).

* Does not depend on an encrypted password databases, or other external
data. Hashauth is completely stateless.

* For each resource, Hashauth requires the master password and the resource
name to derive your password.

* The resource name is an arbitrary string, but could be the domain name of
a site, which is easy to remember.
